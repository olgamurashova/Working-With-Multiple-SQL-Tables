1. Retrieving information from multiple tables:

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;

2. Combining orders and customers using JOIN sequence:

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
  
SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
  
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';

3. Combining two tables:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM online;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
JOIN online
ON newspaper.id = online.id;

4. Combining two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
ON newspaper.id = online.id;

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
ON newspaper.id = online.id
WHERE online.id IS NULL;

5.Joining two tables using primary and foreign keys:

SELECT *
FROM classes
JOIN students
ON classes.id = students.class_id;

6. Combining all rows of one table with all rows of another table using CROSS JOIN:

SELECT shirts.shirt_color,
   pants.pants_color
FROM shirts
CROSS JOIN pants;

7. Filtering data using CROSS JOIN:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
WHERE start_month <= 3
AND end_month >= 3;

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months;

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE start_month <= month
AND end_month >= month;

SELECT month,
COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE start_month <= month
AND end_month >= month
GROUP BY 1;
