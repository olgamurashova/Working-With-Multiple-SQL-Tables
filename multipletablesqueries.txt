1. Retrieving information from multiple tables:

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;

2. Combining orders and customers using JOIN sequence:

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
  
SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
  
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';
